Problems in Code:
	None currently known

Description:
	This code contains Doubly Linked List class that holds integers. DLL objects can be inserted to from the front
or back (as well as removed) and new nodes can be created/removed before or after another certain node. A function is 
also included in order to easily print these lists (operator<<).

Testing:
	Testing was performed mostly through the provided main test file but I did add more cases to verify the integrity
of my insert_before/after and remove_before/after functions.
